#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Suozhi, first year Ph.D. student in Princeton University studying in ECE department. My current interest is in LLM agents which can solve specific hard tasks that human can't even handle.

I did my undergrad Computer Science(major in AI) at Yao Class in Tsinghua University. My past research interests included automated theorem proving, language model reasoning and AI for science(including math, physics and biochem). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) at Caltech. I am also a member of [Internlm-Math](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math) team, developing llm formal math provers. I start my research journey from robotics.

<!-- <font color=red>I am incoming Ph.D. student in Princeton University for the 2025 Fall.</font> -->
