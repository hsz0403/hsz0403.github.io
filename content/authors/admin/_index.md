    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Suozhi, an undergrad student researcher studying Computer Science(major in AI) at Yao Class in Tsinghua University. My research interests include automatic theorem proving, language model reasoning and AI for science(including math, physics and biochem). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) at Caltech. I am also a member of Internlm-Math team, developing llm formal math provers. I start my research journey from robotics.

I am currently applying for Ph.D. programs in Computer Science for the 2024–25 cycle.
