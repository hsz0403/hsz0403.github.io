abstract: We present ActFormer, a Transformer that learns
  birdâ€™s eye view (BEV) representations by using predefined BEV
  queries to interact with multi-robot multi-camera inputs. Each
  BEV query can actively select relevant cameras for information
  aggregation based on pose information, instead of interacting
  with all cameras indiscriminately. Experiments on the V2X-Sim
  dataset demonstrate that ActFormer improves the detection
  performance from 29.89% to 45.15% in terms of AP@0.7
  with about 50% fewer queries, showcasing the effectiveness
  of ActFormer in multi-agent collaborative 3D object detection.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this work, we aim to address scalable
  camera-based collaborative perception with a Transformer-based
  architecture.
